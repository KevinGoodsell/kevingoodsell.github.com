    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>My name is Kevin Goodsell. I am a software engineer in Seattle,
        Washington. I've developed embedded systems for scientific
        applications, voice communication software for servers and hand-held
        computers, and kernel-mode and user space software for a distributed
        file system. I'm interested in many areas of computer technology,
        including graphics, audio, networking, software quality and
        troubleshooting, security, and open source systems such as GNU/Linux.

        <p>My résumé is available in <a href="resume/resume.html">HTML</a> and
        in <a href="resume/Kevin-Goodsell-resume.pdf">PDF</a>. I'm not currently
        seeking employment.

        <p>This page is a work in progress. I'll be adding more to it later.
