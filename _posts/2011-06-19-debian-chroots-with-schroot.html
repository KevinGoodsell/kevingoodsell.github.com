<p><i>This post isn't quite ready yet. Needs a final read-through and edit, and
a walkthrough of the techniques to make sure they work.</i>

<p>One of my new favorite tools in Debian is schroot. schroot makes it easy to
maintain and use chroot environments. If you are not familiar with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot</a> environments, they are
essentially a complete system installed in a directory which you can switch to
using the chroot(2) system call. You can think of this as a basic form of
operating system
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization">
virtualization</a>.

<p>schroot allows you enter a chroot without requiring root credentials,
automatically mounts important file systems inside the chroot, and allows you to
create sessions from a chroot that function like an independent chroot that
disappears when you are finished with it, leaving the source chroot in its
original condition. You can install software, make configuration changes, create
new users, run daemons, etc. and all of that will disappear when you terminate
the session.

<h3>Creating a chroot With debootstrap</h3>

<p>To use schroot, you first need a chroot environment to use it with. The easy
way to do this in Debian is with the debootstrap program, available in the
package of the same name. debootstrap downloads and installs packages
into a new directory to create an initial install that can be used as a
chroot environment:

{% highlight text %}
# debootstrap --include=locales,less,sudo,ncurses-term,vim sid sid-chroot
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This command installs a Debian Sid system in the directory
sid-chroot, and includes a few additional packages. <tt>locales</tt> and
<tt>less</tt> are probably good things to include in general, the rest
are specific to how I work, and you may not need them.

<p>It's possible to switch immediately to this chroot with the
<tt>chroot</tt> command, but that's not as interesting or as useful as
what we can do with schroot.

<h3>Basic schroot Configuration and Use</h3>

<p>To get started, we need an entry for our chroot in the schroot
configuration file, <tt>/etc/schroot/schroot.conf</tt>:

{% highlight text %}
[sid-basic]
description=Sid sample chroot
type=directory
directory=/home/kevin/test/chroots/sid-chroot
union-type=aufs
users=kevin
source-users=kevin
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Note that <tt>kevin</tt> is my username and the directory is set to
the full path to the chroot environment created with debootstrap.
Replace these with something appropriate.

<p>With this configuration we can use schroot to enter the chroot
environment:

{% highlight text %}
$ schroot -c sid-basic
{% endhighlight %}

<p>There are a few things to note about this:
<ol>
  <li>Users specified in the <tt>users</tt> field of the configuration
  file don't need to provide credentials to enter the chroot
  environment.
  <li>This type of chroot is "session managed", meaning that entering it
  creates a new session that exists until you exit the chroot. Changes
  made to the system within the session disappear when the session ends.
  More on this later.
  <li>While <em>some</em> changes in this chroot are transient, schroot
  mounts parts of the host file system inside the chroot environment.
  Changes here will affect the host file system, so be careful.
</ol>

<p>To get a better understanding of what is happening, exit the chroot
environment (just use the <tt>exit</tt> command to end the shell process
and return to the previous shell). Next, we'll start a named session.
You can enter and leave the session as needed, and the session will
persist until it is explicitly ended. The commands to create and enter
the session follow:

{% highlight text %}
$ schroot --begin-session --session-name=test -c sid-basic
$ schroot --run-session -c test
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, from a second terminal, run <tt>mount</tt> on the host system.
In addition to the normal mounts you typically have on your system,
you'll see several associated with this schroot session:

{% highlight text %}
/home/kevin/test/chroots/sid-chroot on /var/lib/schroot/union/underlay/test type none (rw,bind)
test on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test type aufs (rw,br:/var/lib/schroot/union/overlay/test:/var/lib/schroot/union/underlay/test=ro)
/proc on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test/proc type none (rw,bind)
/sys on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test/sys type none (rw,bind)
/dev on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test/dev type none (rw,bind)
/home on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test/home type none (rw,bind)
/tmp on /var/lib/schroot/mount/test/tmp type none (rw,bind)

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The first two mounts create a union file system for the root file
system of the chroot. The "underlay" portion is the base chroot
directory, and it is mounted as a read-only layer. The "overlay" on top
of that is writable, but is deleted when the session ends.

<p>The remaining mounts add common file systems to the chroot
environment&mdash;<tt>/proc</tt>, <tt>/sys</tt>, <tt>/dev</tt>,
<tt>/home</tt>, and <tt>/tmp</tt>. Mounting <tt>/home</tt> is
convenient, but has some undesirable consequences. The first is that it
makes experimenting in the chroot environment rather dangerous, since
you can destroy your files. The second is that creating new users in the
chroot environment will create home directories that persist after the
session is ended. I'll discuss the first concern later. To deal with the
second concern while still having the convenience of being able to
access my files, I like to mount <tt>/home/kevin</tt> in the chroot
instead of mounting all of <tt>/home</tt>. The next section explains how
to further customize a chroot to accomplish things like this.

<p>When you are finished with a named session, you can end it with a
command like this:

{% highlight text %}
$ schroot --end-session -c test
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Custom schroot Configurations</h3>

<p>schroot has a stock set of configuration types located in directories
in the <tt>/etc/schroot</tt> directory: default, desktop, minimal, and
sbuild. You can create your own configurations based on these. To start
with, copy the <tt>default</tt> directory to a new directory called
<tt>custom</tt>. Edit the file <tt>custom/config</tt> and change the
paths to refer to the files in the <tt>custom</tt> directory:

{% highlight text %}
# Filesystems to mount inside the chroot.
FSTAB="/etc/schroot/custom/fstab"

# Files to copy from the host system into the chroot.
COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/custom/copyfiles"

# System NSS databases to copy into the chroot.
NSSDATABASES="/etc/schroot/custom/nssdatabases"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next, edit the <tt>custom/copyfiles</tt> file. This is a list of
files that are copied from the host system to the chroot system each
time a new session is started. By default this includes only
<tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/gshadow</tt>. I like to add
<tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> since I use sudo rather than the root account. I
also prefer to remove <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>, because I think a
static file in the chroot is more useful. For example, if I start a
session on my laptop while connected to some coffee shop wifi network,
the DNS servers provided may not be useful on any other network.

<p>Now edit the <tt>fstab</tt> file. The main change I typically make
here is to replace the <tt>/home</tt> mount with a <tt>/home/kevin</tt>
mount. The first two fields should both be changed. This allows access
to my files inside the chroot while also allowing me to create new users
with their own home directories which will not persist beyond the end of
the session. This wouldn't work so well if the chroot was configured for
use by multiple users.

<p>I'm skipping the <tt>nssdatabases</tt> file because I don't typically
find any reason to make changes there. You may want to, however.

<p>To make use of the custom configuration, make sure you've ended any
schroot sessions and edit the entry in
<tt>/etc/schroot/schroot.conf</tt> adding this line:

{% highlight text %}
script-config=custom/config
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Managing Source Chroots</h3>

<p>Chroots with a <tt>union-type</tt> setting fall into a category known
as <em>source chroots</em>. Source chroots are used as sessions, where
changes made within the session only last as long as the session is
active. In other words, they have a <em>source</em> which is used to
generate the session, but which is not modified by using the session.

<p>Source chroots provide an additional chroot with a name constructed
by appending <tt>-source</tt> to the end of the original name, and which
is accessible by users listed in the <tt>source-users</tt> setting.
Changes made in this chroot are persistent, affecting all future
sessions.

<p>As a simple example of modifying a source chroot, lets look at a
problem you are likely to encounter using chroots. If you have a
terminal that uses UTF-8 (as many do today), you might have
<tt>LANG=en_US.UTF-8</tt> (for example) in your environment. In a new
chroot, this will produce some problems. When running <tt>man</tt>, you
may see this error:

{% highlight text %}
man: can't set the locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Many other commands will produce similar errors. This is because the
system locales are not configured. This is easy to fix, but if you fix
it in a session you'll just need to fix it again in the next session.
Instead, go to the chroot's source and make the changes there:

{% highlight text %}
$ schroot -c sid-basic-source
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Edit <tt>/etc/locale.gen</tt>, uncomment the locales you might actually
use, save and quit, then run <tt>locale-gen</tt>. Now you can leave the
chroot and the changes will persist into your future sessions.

<p>By using the chroot's source you can install software you always want
to have available in your sessions, update installed packages, etc.

<h3>Another Custom Configuration</h3>

<p>One advantage of working in a chroot environment is that you can
protect files on the host system from accidental modification or
deletion. However, as mentioned earlier, the configurations we've looked
at so far mount users' home directories inside the chroot, negating
some of these benefits. This is a matter of convenience versus security,
and the right way to go depends on what you are trying to accomplish. By
using a second schroot configuration, we can support both arrangements.
This new configuration will use a home folder that exists inside the
chroot rather than on the host system, and furthermore will allow
running X applications using the host's display.

<p>To begin with, in <tt>/etc/schroot/</tt> copy the directory
<tt>desktop</tt> to a new directory named <tt>nohome</tt>. Starting with
the desktop configuration makes it easier to get X applications working.
The changes that need to be made to the new configuration are similar to
what was done previously. Fix up the paths in <tt>nohome/config</tt>
and make any desired changes in <tt>nohome/copyfiles</tt> and
<tt>nohome/nssdatabases</tt>. In <tt>nohome/fstab</tt>, delete the
<tt>/home</tt> line. If you use gdm3, uncomment the line to mount
<tt>/var/run/gdm3</tt>. Sid seems to put this in a different location,
so I also had to change the mount point to <tt>/run/gdm3</tt>.

<p>Now in <tt>/etc/schroot/schroot.conf</tt> add a section to create a
new chroot using this configuration:

{% highlight text %}
[sid-nohome]
description=Sid with /home not mounted
type=directory
directory=/home/kevin/test/chroots/sid-chroot
union-type=aufs
users=kevin
source-users=kevin
script-config=nohome/config
preserve-environment=true
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is just like the sid-basic chroot, but using the nohome
configuration and including a new setting,
<tt>preserve-environment=true</tt>. This setting imports environment
variables from the host to the chroot, including things like <tt>DISPLAY</tt>
and <tt>XAUTHORITY</tt> that allow X applications to access the display.

<p>If you don't use gdm3, you will probably need an alternative strategy
to get your Xauthority file into the chroot environment. One option that
seems to work is to add <tt>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.Xauthority</tt> to
<tt>/etc/schroot/nohome/copyfiles</tt>.

<p>Once this is set up, you will probably want to enter the source chroot and
create your home directory there. You may want to add some base files that will
be available in any session using the chroot, such as shell initialization
files.
