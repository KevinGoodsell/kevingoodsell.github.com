<p>My last few posts were about the solutions I've been writing for the problems
from <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. There are a lot of
problems, and commentary on the individual solutions aren't all that
interesting.

<p>Therefore, instead of posting solutions here I've started pushing them to a
<a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/project-euler">GitHub repository</a>.
At the time of writing, I've solved the first 45 problems.

<p>A few of the problems offered opportunities to use dynamic programming,
which is a technique I haven't encountered much since leaving college. I was
glad to have a chance to use it again, and refresh my memory. The result tends
to be a very fast solution.

<p>Some problems require very large integers, and in some cases I'm using the
<tt>long long</tt> type which isn't officially part of C++. However, even this
isn't big enough for some problems. In a few cases I "faked" arbitrary precision
integers, then at problem 20 I started to implement a separate <tt>BigInt</tt>
class, but only having the parts I needed for that problem. I quickly decided
that it would be more useful to use a common arbitrary precision library, and
switched to using <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> for later problems that
required very large integers. Reinventing the wheel isn't really the point of
the problems, after all.

<p>I eventually added a utility module for things that I've been using over and
over again, such as a primality testing function. There are still many copies of
this function in the earlier problems because I didn't bother to update them.
Once I have the solution, I consider the program complete.
