title: Diagnosable Software Failures

<p>It's hard to overstate the importance of making software failures
diagnosable. Easily diagnosable failures allow users to discover the underlying
problem themselves, and get to a resolution much more easily. Difficult to
diagnose failures result in support requests that take forever to resolve, a lot
of back-and-forth while attempting to narrow down the cause, and massive
frustration on both sides. Often they result in the sort of bug report that sits
in the bug tracking system month after month waiting for a reliable way to
reproduce the problem or a recurrence from which more information can be
gathered.

<p>Ideally failures should be diagnosed clearly and immediately, in a way that
allows the user to understand what he or she needs to do. Somewhat less
desirable are diagnostics that can be obtained from log files, by turning on
special options, or by using special tools. The worst case is the lack of any
useful diagnostic information, perhaps requiring a developer to examine the
source code for clues, run under a debugger, etc.

<p>There's something to be said for recognizing when certain classes of problems
tend to be difficult to diagnose, and finding ways to make them easier. Yes it's
a reactive approach, and not ideal, but we have to deal with the realities of
software development and support.

<h3>Python ImportErrors</h3>

<p>Anybody who has used Python at all is familiar with this error:

<pre class="code">
ImportError: No module named foo
</pre>

<p>This is usually no more than a minor hassle for a Python developer, but for a
non-developer using a Python application it's a complete dead-end. The error
could be in Sanskrit for all the good it does an end-user. Unfortunately, the
nature of Python applications ensures this error will sometimes pop up -- any
application that grows beyond a single file will need to import its other parts,
and where Python searches for additional modules to import is often unclear.

<p>As an example, consider a message that was posted on the mailing list for the
Python application <a href="http://tmda.net/">TMDA</a>, which included this
error (and little else):

<pre class="code">
ImportError: No module named TMDA
</pre>

<p>In a follow-up message the user also included the installation path for the
TMDA package: <tt>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/TMDA</tt>.

<p>We can infer therefore that <tt>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages</tt>
is not in Python's <tt>sys.path</tt>, but why isn't it? How can we instruct the
user to diagnose this problem?

<h3>Module Hide-and-Seek</h3>

<p>The first thing I did was look up how site package directories are added to
the module path. They are supposed to be added on interpreter startup by the
<tt>site.py</tt> module, but paths that don't exist are not included. This is
unfortunate from a troubleshooting perspective: if the paths were included it
would be a simple matter to check where a particular Python installation expects
modules to be located.

<p>The site module constructs paths to check by combining the values of
<tt>sys.prefix</tt> and <tt>sys.exec_prefix</tt> (the values of which are
determined at configuration-time) with some platform-specific trailing paths --
in this case the relevant one being <tt>lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages</tt>, where
X.Y is the Python version. Since I knew that
<tt>/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages</tt> existed, I concluded that
<tt>/usr/local</tt> must not be one of the prefix values. I asked the user to
check these values, and suggested a fix based on my conclusion.

<p>Unfortunately my conclusion was wrong. <tt>sys.prefix</tt> actually was
<tt>/usr/local</tt>, as was <tt>sys.exec_prefix</tt>. I was on the right track,
but took a wrong turn when I assumed the prefix was the problem. It was actually
the trailing portion of the path that had an unexpected value: rather than
<tt>lib/python2.6/site-packages</tt>, it was
<tt>lib/python2.7/site-packages</tt>. The user had multiple Python versions
installed and was running 2.7, not 2.6.

<h3>A Better Way</h3>

<p>When diagnosing import issues, it would be a significant improvement if we
could list not just the module search paths (which is easy), but the potential
module search paths, including those paths that were excluded from the final
module paths (typically because the path doesn't exist). The <tt>site.py</tt>
module can be run as a script to print out the final paths as well as some
potentially useful information about user-specified module paths. It could have
been written to also report the excluded paths, but sadly it wasn't. It also
doesn't offer much in the way of hooks to retrieve more information, but here's
one way to list the paths that it failed to find:

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

import site
import os

original_isdir = os.path.isdir
missed_dirs = set()
def isdir(path):
    if original_isdir(path):
        return True
    else:
        missed_dirs.add(path)
        return False

os.path.isdir = isdir

try:
    site._script()
finally:
    print "Possibly skipped paths:"
    print '\n'.join(missed_dirs)
{% endhighlight %}

<pre class="code">
$ ./show-import-dirs
sys.path = [
    '/home/kevin/test',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/plat-linux2',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-tk',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-old',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload',
    '/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages',
    '/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages',
]
USER_BASE: '/home/kevin/.local' (exists)
USER_SITE: '/home/kevin/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages' (doesn't exist)
ENABLE_USER_SITE: True
Possibly skipped paths:
/home/kevin/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages
</pre>
