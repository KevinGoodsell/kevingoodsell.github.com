title: Converting MS Word Forms to OpenOffice.org

<p>I was recently given a form to fill out that was in MS Word format. As a
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> user I of course used
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> to open it (Debian's
stable release doesn't have
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>).

<p>While I don't expect Word files to import perfectly into OpenOffice, I was
flummoxed by the way the form fields were imported. Instead of editable fields,
they were grayed-out sequences of space characters. These could be edited, but
not very conveniently. I also couldn't find any way to convert them to the
normal OpenOffice input fields. There was no indication that the application had
any way of identifying or changing the field type.

<p>Since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a>
files are just zip files with XML to define the document structure, it wasn't
too hard to find the XML markup for the problem fields. The fields were
identified with the tags <tt>&lt;field:fieldmark-start/&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;field:fieldmark-end/&gt;</tt>, and a few minutes on Google suggested
that these are an extension specifically for MS Word compatibility.

<p>Fortunately I found a (sort of) convenient way to convert these fields.
First, I discovered that OpenOffice can save in a format that I didn't know
about before: a flat XML version of OpenDocument. This makes editing or just
viewing the XML much more convenient. It even produces nicely indented XML
rather than the one huge line of text you get if you unzip an ODF file.

<p>After converting to this format, all I had to do was open it in Vim and
search for all the instances of the fieldmark tags replace them with the
OpenDocument text-input tag,
<tt>&lt;text:text-input text:description=""/&gt;</tt>.
The description text corresponds to the field name, and the element text can be
used to provide an initial value for the field.

<p>The resulting file can be opened in OpenOffice and saved as a normal ODF.
This could be a very handy tool for sticky OpenOffice/LibreOffice formatting
issues, something that isn't too far removed from everyone's favorite feature
from WordPerfect, Reveal Codes.
