        <p>This is a brief description of some of my projects with links to the
        source code where applicable.

        <h3>Tagged Message Delivery Agent</h3>

        <p><a href="http://tmda.net/">Tagged Message Delivery Agent</a> is an
        email filtering and spam-prevention system. I originally forked this
        project because it had been idle for a few years and I wasn't happy with
        its SSL/TLS support, and because it had some problems with newer
        versions of Python. After making several updates and releasing a few new
        versions, the original author made me an official maintainer for the
        project. The main code is repository is on SourceForge, but my Git
        repository can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/tmda-fork">here</a>. The work
        I've done on the project includes:

        <ul>
            <li>Updates for modern Python versions
            <li>Adding support for OpenSSL
            <li>Adding support for PAM authentication
            <li>Adding tests
            <li>Creating a new documentation generating tool
            <li>Adding UNIX man pages
            <li>Adding support for IPv6
            <li>Adding packaging for Debian/Ubuntu</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mork Converter</h3>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/mork-converter">mork-converrter</a>
        is an application I wrote to convert Mozilla Mork files to more useful
        formats. A handful of simple tools are available to convert certain
        types of Mork files, but this is the only application other than Mozilla
        that attempts to properly parse and process all Mork files, making it
        the only reliable way to extract data from these files. It uses an
        extensible architecture for providing output formats, with XML and CVS
        support currently available. It handles text data encoded in many
        different ways, producing UTF-8 output by default, though other
        encodings are available. It also interprets many of the fields found in
        Mork files to present things like dates and times, as well as many
        application-specific flags, in a readable format.

        <h3>Rsync Backup</h3>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/rsync-backup">rsync-backup</a>
        is a simple but powerful script for performing backups using rsync to do
        the heavy lifting. It creates backups that are simply a directory with
        subdirectories and files, mirroring the original source. Files can be
        restored by simply copying them, and earlier versions can be examined
        without any extra tools. Disk space is conserved by hard-linking files
        that have not been modified since the previous backup. Because it uses
        rsync, backups can be performed to a local disk or a remote location
        using rsync's highly-optimized data transfer algorithms. Also supports
        validating backups, extensive logging, flexible include/exclude
        patterns, and dry-run execution for testing.

        <h3>Vim Plugins</h3>

        <p>I've written several small plugins for Vim, several of which are
        collected <a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/vim-scripts">here</a>.
        The README file describes each plugin, but briefly they include plugins
        to:

        <ul>
            <li>Detect the indentation scheme used in a file, and set options
            accordingly
            <li>Display side-by-side differences between the current file and an
            earlier revision in source control
            <li>Toggle between editing text and binary using a hex-editing mode
            <li>Securely edit files encrypted with GNU Privacy Guard
            <li>Highlight various forms of whitespace and indentation errors
            <li>Support additional keys and key combinations in some terminals
        </ul>

        <p>Finally, these two additional plugins are not found in the above
        collection:

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/vim-csexact">CSExact</a>
            uses terminal escape codes to modify the terminal's color palette in
            order to exactly mimic the colors used in the GUI version of Vim,
            when using a color scheme that supports the GUI.
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/vim-color-check">vim-color-check</a>
            checks for common errors in Vim color schemes.
        </ul>
